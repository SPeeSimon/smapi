Hi,

We would like to let you know that the object (update, deletion) request #<%= it.request.id %> was successfully treated.

<%if (it.comment) {%>
The screener left a comment for you: '<%~ it.comment%>'

<%}%>
Please don't forget to use the massive import form rather than the single one if you have many objects to add!

<%~ includeFile('./signature.email.txt', {}) %>
