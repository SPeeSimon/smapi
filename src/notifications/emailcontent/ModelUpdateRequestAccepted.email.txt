Hi,

On <%= it.dtg %> UTC, you issued a 3D model update request (#<%= it.request.id %> named '<%~ it.modelMD.name %>').

We are glad to let you know that this request has been accepted!

<%if (it.comment) {%>
The screener left a comment for you: '<%~ it.comment%>'

You can check the model at https://scenery.flightgear.org/app.php?c=Models&a=view&id=<%~ it.modelMD.id %>
