Hi,

On <%= it.dtg %> UTC, someone from the IP address <%= it.ipaddr %> (<%= it.host %>), which is thought to be you, issued a object(s) addition request (#<%= it.request.id %>).

We would like to let you know that this request has been sent for validation. Allow up to a few days for your request to be processed.
